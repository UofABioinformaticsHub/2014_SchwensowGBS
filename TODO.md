# TO DO

- Run previous analysis
- Strip TF out of VCF & send to Nina. Also restrict this to snps after LD pruning & after filtering structural SNPs from the PCA
- For Minotaur we need output from all tests ($p$-values) & maybe F~ST~ from `populations.fst_1-2.tsv.gz`
- Grab FET p-value from `populations.fst_1-2.tsv.gz`
