# TO DO

- [x] Grab FET p-value from `populations.fst_1-2.tsv.gz` (This is identical to the allele frequency test p-value, so is not worth adding)
- [x] Add distances to SNPs in tables, and information about being within coding regions etc
- [x] Add table for Bayescan results
- [x] Export tables to csv
- [x] Simulation
